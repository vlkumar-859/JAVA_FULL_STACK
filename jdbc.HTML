				INTRODUCTION
			</h3>
			<p>
				JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases.
			</p>
			<divn style="text-align: center;">
				<p style="font-size: 20px;">WHAT IS API ?</p>
				<p>
					Application programming interfaces, or APIs, simplify software development and innovation by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.

				TYPES OF DRIVERS 
			</h3>
			<p >There are mainly 4 types of drivers :</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Type-1 driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls.</li>
					<li>The ODBC bridge driver is needed to be installed in individual client machines.</li>
					<li>Type-1 driver isn’t written in java, that’s why it isn’t a portable driver.</li>
					<li>This driver software is built-in with JDK so no need to install separately.</li>
					<li>It is a database independent driver.</li>
					<li>Type-1 driver is also called Universal driver because it can be used to connect to any of the databases.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<li>Type-2 driver or Native-API driver</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This driver converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API</li>
					<li>In order to interact with different database, this driver needs their local API, that’s why data transfer is much more secure as compared to type-1 driver.</li>
					<li>Driver needs to be installed separately in individual client machines</li>
					<li>Type-2 driver isn’t written in java, that’s why it isn’t a portable driver</li>
					<li>It is a database dependent driver</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<li>Type-3 driver or Network Protocol driver</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol. Here all the database connectivity drivers are present in a single server, hence no need of individual client-side installation</li>
					<li>Type-3 drivers are fully written in Java, hence they are portable drivers.</li>
					<li>No client side library is required because of application server that can perform many tasks like auditing, load balancing, logging etc.</li>
					<li>Network support is required on client machine.</li>
					<li>Maintenance of Network Protocol driver becomes costly because it requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.</li>
					<li>Switch facility to switch over from one database to another database.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<li>Type-4 driver or Thin driver</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This driver interact directly with database. It does not require any native database library, that is why it is also known as Thin Driver.</li>
					<li>Does not require any native library and Middleware server, so no client-side or server-side installation.</li>
					<li>It is fully written in Java language, hence they are portable drivers.</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
			<h3 style="font-size:25px">
				WHEN TO USE A PARTICULAR DRIVER ?
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you are accessing one type of database, such as Oracle, Sybase, or IBM, the preferred driver type is type-4. 
				</li>
				<li>
					If your Java application is accessing multiple types of databases at the same time, type 3 is the preferred driver. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Type 2 drivers are useful in situations, where a type 3 or type 4 driver is not available yet for your database.
				</li>
				<li>
					The type 1 driver is not considered a deployment-level driver, and is typically used for development and testing purposes only.
				</li>
